# Spotify Sleep Timer

## Description

I created this project so I could create a sleep timer for when I use Spotify to listen to music when I fall asleep.  So far I created a very simple interface that is only used by accessing the command line. I have future ideas that I might implement over time labeled in the future goals section. This is an ongoing project which I will update as I add more features.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies
- Windows 10 OS
- Python Installed

### Executing Program
- Open up terminal
- Run code below
   
 ```python sleeptimer.py```

> **Note:** The **sleeptimer.exe** can only be ran on Windows OS. This is due to using PyInstaller only being able to create executable for the system in which it was bundled on.



## Future Goals
- Create a Gui for ease of access for nontechnical people.
- Add argparse to include different features such as being able to hide/see the PID's.
- Packaging to work with other OS (may require separate script).
