# SpotifySleepTimer

## Description

I created this project so I could create a sleep timer for when I use spotify to listen to music when I fall asleep. 

## Dependencies
- Windows 10 OS
- Python Installed

## Executing Program
- Open up terminal
- Run code below

> **Note:** The **sleeptimer.exe** can only be ran on Windows OS. This is due to using PyInstaller only being able to create executable for the system in which it was bundled on.

python sleeptimer.py
